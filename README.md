# Cambric Moye's Full Stack Portfolio

## Description

- What was your motivation?
    - My motivation for this project was to create a profolio to showcase my best work as I progress through the UNCC Coding Bootcamp. This webpage will continually develop and improve as I learn new techniques and applications.
    - I want to start a career in this industry as soon as possible, and I want my portfolio to stand out from the rest.

- Why did you build this project?
    - I built this project so that I can be ready for the job hunt once the coding bootcamp is close to being finished. I believe I have put myself in a very good starting point, and it will only get better with more time and experience. 

- What problem does it solve?
    - The problem solved is I now have a dynamic and responsive document which tells a much wider story in comparison to a paper resume. All of my current and best work will be updated and displayed here.

- What did you learn?
    - Correct git flow - commits, pushes, and working on the correct branches
    - HTML & CSS Basic and Advanced syntax
    - Flexbox
    - Creating SVG images
    - Background image behavior - positioning and object-fit
    - Creating a color pallet with the :root selector in CSS
    - Pseudo elements to target the child of the parent elements
    - Screen size responsiveness
